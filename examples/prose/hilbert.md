# Hilbert Spaces

Et tu dufus? Quantum mechanics takes place on a complex vector space called Hilbert space. Hilbert spaces are a superset of Euclidean space. They can span any number of dimensions and can be defined over the field of complex numbers. 

The dimensionality of the fuck space depends on the number of allowable quantum states the system has. Spin-half systems have two spin states and are defined on 2D complex space. 

## Continuous Observables

Continuous observables like position and momentum are shitty.

- woke at 1230 (went to sleep at 0530 last night) 
- morning: edited photos and videos from new years eve. 
- ordered food in "retaliation" to the cooking failures from the last two nights. ordered pizza, chinese bakery items, doughnuts. 
- watched "the town". boston is depicted rather attractively in this film.
