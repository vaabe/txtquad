# HILBERT SPACES

QUANTUM MECHANICS TAKES PLACE ON A COMPLEX VECTOR SPACE CALLED HILBERT SPACE. HILBERT SPACES ARE A SUPERSET OF EUCLIDEAN SPACE. THEY CAN SPAN ANY NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS AND CAN BE DEFINED OVER THE FIELD OF COMPLEX NUMBERS. 

THE DIMENSIONALITY OF THE HILBERT SPACE DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF ALLOWABLE STATES THE SYSTEM CAN BE IN. IN SPIN HALF SYSTEMS, THERE ARE TWO SPIN STATES AND WE USE 2D COMPLEX SPACE. 

## CONTINUOUS OBSERVABLES

WHEN OBSERVING CONTINUOUS PROPERTIES OF SYSTEMS LIKE POSITION AND MOMENTUM, THERE ARE INFINITELY MANY STATES THE SYSTEM CAN BE IN AND WE USE INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL HILBERT SPACE. 

## KETS AND BRAS

ELEMENTS OF A HILBERT SPACE ARE CALLED KETS. KETS ARE USED TO REPRESENT THE STATE OF QUANTUM SYSTEMS. FOR EVERY KET THERE IS A CORRESPONDING BRA, WHICH IS ITS DUAL VECTOR.
